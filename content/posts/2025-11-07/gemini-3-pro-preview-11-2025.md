## 🎯 Testing Context
Google's major release, Gemini 3 Pro, claims to be a full competitor to GPT-5. As an AI tools blogger, I ran four rounds of rigorous tests overnight. The results were a mix of admiration and frustration!

**Current Availability:** Google Vertex AI & Gemini CLI

To log in to Gemini CLI using your Google account, enter `gemini --model gemini-3-pro-preview-11-2025` in the terminal to launch Gemini.

## 🎮 Round 3: Web-Based Minecraft Clone

**Prompt:** Create a complete 3D Minecraft clone in a single HTML file, including terrain generation, mobs, and Three.js rendering.

**Initial Performance:**
• 🤖 **Gemini 3 Pro:** Basic functions worked, but movement keys were reversed, and jump function was missing.
