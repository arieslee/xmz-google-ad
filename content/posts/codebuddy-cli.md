# First Encounter with CodeBuddy: An AI Software Engineer in the Command Line

That afternoon, I was struggling with refactoring a complex project – needing to migrate dozens of Vue components to React Hooks. Based on past experience, this would take me at least two full days. Just as I was about to start this tedious task, a colleague recommended Tencent's newly released CodeBuddy CLI.

"This thing lets AI write code for you using natural language," he said. "It's like hiring a full-stack engineer right in your command line."

With a skeptical attitude, I began my experience. The result was shocking: what would have taken two days, CodeBuddy helped me complete in 3 hours, and the code quality was surprisingly high.

## What is CodeBuddy CLI?


Official website: [https://codebuddy.ai/cli](https://codebuddy.ai/cli)

CodeBuddy CLI is an autonomously orchestrated programming agent launched by Tencent for developers. Simply put, it integrates an AI brain directly into the command-line environment, allowing you to command AI to complete various programming tasks using natural language.

Unlike traditional code completion tools, CodeBuddy CLI possesses true autonomous operation capabilities:



* Directly access and modify local code files

* Call MCP services to perform complex operations

* Run system commands and access network resources

* Work stably in non-interactive environments such as CI/CD pipelines

Core value: It breaks the traditional programming model of "memorize complex commands → execute manually" and realizes an intelligent workflow of "describe in natural language → AI executes automatically".

## Three Key Features, Redefining the Development Experience

🚀 **Terminal-native, Zero-cost Integration**

As a deep command-line user, what I appreciate most is that CodeBuddy is fully integrated into existing development environments. No need to learn new interfaces, no need to change work habits – you can get AI superpowers directly in your familiar terminal.

⚡ **Ready to Use, Powerful Features**

CodeBuddy comes with a complete development toolchain:



* Intelligent file editing and code refactoring

* Git operations and automatic commit message generation

* Test execution and code review

* Easy expansion of third-party services via MCP protocol

🔄 **Perfect Embodiment of Unix Philosophy**

CodeBuddy follows the classic Unix design philosophy and can seamlessly integrate with existing toolchains. It supports pipeline operations and can be integrated into shell scripts like grep and awk, making automated workflows extremely powerful.

## Practical Installation: Set Up AI Development Environment in Ten Minutes

### Environment Preparation



* Operating system: Windows 11 (also supports macOS and Linux)

* Node.js version: v22.20.0 or higher

* Network requirements: Need access to international or domestic services

### Installation Steps



1. **Install Node.js**

Go to the Node.js official website to download the installation package, and verify the version after completion:



```
node -v  # v22.20.0

npm -v   # 10.9.3
```



1. **Solve execution policy issues (Windows only)**



```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```



1. **Configure npm mirror (for Chinese users)**



```
npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
```



1. **Install CodeBuddy CLI**



```
npm install -g @tencent-ai/codebuddy-code
```



1. **Verify version**



```
codebuddy --version
```

1. **Account login**

Running the `codebuddy` command for the first time will guide you through the login process, supporting various methods such as Google, GitHub, and WeChat.


I chose WeChat here

Tips to avoid problems: If you encounter issues with an outdated npm version during installation, first run `npm install -g npm@latest` to upgrade npm.

After successful login, the following will be displayed


## Real Case: Rapid Development from Idea to Launch

### Case: Developing a Snake Game in 5 Minutes

I wanted to test CodeBuddy's limits, so I gave it a simple instruction:

"Create a snake game using html+javascript"

It created a `snake.html` file for me, but I encountered a bug when running it. I asked it to help fix the bug:

"There's a bug. The game ends automatically after clicking restart"


After fixing the bug once, there were no more issues.

The final generated game was fully playable with clear code structure, even including responsive design. The same workload would have taken at least 3 hours of manual development.

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Initial Project Analysis

Run `codebuddy /init` to let AI scan your project and generate a `codebuddy.md` document, recording all module functions and dependency relationships, which makes subsequent AI interactions more accurate.

### Session Management



* Use `/compact` to clean up session history while retaining context summaries

* The `export` command can export complete conversation records

* `/model` supports switching between different AI models

### Permission Control

CodeBuddy will request confirmation before performing sensitive operations. You can choose "Yes, and don't ask again this session" to improve efficiency for batch operations.

## The Future of Developers: From Coders to AI Conductors

After using CodeBuddy CLI extensively, I've come to several important conclusions:

### Efficiency improvement is real

In appropriate scenarios, CodeBuddy can bring 300%-600% efficiency improvement, especially in:



* Prototype development and proof of concept

* Repetitive code writing

* Technology stack migration and refactoring

* Document generation and code review

### The developer role is evolving

AI won't replace developers but will redefine development work:



* Past: Memorizing syntax + manual coding

* Now: Requirement analysis + AI command + quality control

We are transforming from "code porters" to "AI conductors", requiring stronger architecture design, requirement analysis, and quality control capabilities.

### The learning curve is almost zero

If you're familiar with command-line operations, getting started with CodeBuddy takes only 10 minutes. Its natural language interaction mode significantly reduces the technical threshold.

## Start Your AI Programming Journey

CodeBuddy CLI is currently completely free, requiring only an email address to register and use. I recommend starting your experience with these scenarios:



* Code understanding: Let AI analyze the working principles of complex modules

* Small tool development: Try creating practical scripts with natural language

* Code refactoring: Let AI optimize existing code structure

* Learning new technologies: Quickly master new frameworks through practical projects

Useful tip: For first-time use, it's recommended to run `codebuddy /init` to scan existing projects, which helps AI better understand your code environment.

The wheels of the times are accelerating. AI programming has moved from concept to practice. Tools like CodeBuddy CLI are not previews of the future but current realities. The only question is: are you ready to embrace this change?
