## Generate a Complete PPT with a Single Sentence

Imagine you have a 50-page product document. Now, you just need to throw it at Gemini and say "Make it into a PPT," bingo! A complete, designed PPT is ready.

**Time required? Less than a minute.**

Furthermore, this isn't some shoddy text dump—each slide comes with images, design, and clear hierarchy.

**The best part? Free users can use it too.**

Let's give a shout-out to the generous folks at Google.

## 01 | The Underestimated Canvas

Those who frequently use Gemini are likely familiar with the Canvas feature.

While it was launched following the trend set by Claude and ChatGPT, the experience is actually quite good.

Canvas was originally a separate workspace, primarily used for writing and coding tasks.

**The new feature we're discussing today is hidden within Canvas.**

You can either give Gemini a topic to generate a PPT from scratch, or upload documents, images, and tables as source material.

Just like this.

Gemini will generate a complete PPT directly based on your materials.

**What's even better** is that Google has integrated its own ecosystem—the generated PPT can be directly imported into [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) for further editing.

It handles everything from content generation to collaborative editing, all in one seamless flow.

## 02 | How to Use It? 3 Simple Steps

Currently, this feature is only available on the Gemini web version and is not yet supported in the mobile app.

**The good news is**, both free users and AI Pro members can use it (personally verified).

1.  Open [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and log in.

2.  **Key Point**: You must select Canvas from the toolbar in the bottom-left corner of the input box.

    Tests show that failing to do this only generates an outline, not the full PPT.

3.  Then, simply input your prompt in a conversational style, instructing Gemini to generate the PPT.

    For example: "Create a PPT based on this document."

    Remember to upload any necessary source files.

## 03 | Hands-On Test: Trying it with NVIDIA's Earnings Report

I used NVIDIA's latest earnings report to test this feature.

Let's look at the results directly.

As you can see, what Gemini generates isn't just a wall of text, but a complete PPT with pre-defined themes and images.

**Here's the crucial part**: All the images in the PPT above were found and added by Gemini itself.

The original NVIDIA earnings report contained only text and tables, no images.

Honestly, it might look more professional than what I could make myself.

The generated PPT can be imported into Google Slides to open and edit, or it can be exported directly as a PDF.

Of course, it's difficult to generate a perfect PPT on the first try.

At this point, you have two options:

*   Import it into Google Slides and edit manually.
*   Continue the conversation within Gemini, asking it to make revisions.

Tests show the revision feature works quite well.

However, each revision requires regenerating the entire PPT, which can be time-consuming.

## Conclusion

ChatGPT doesn't have a feature to directly generate PPTs.

Claude has one, but the results are relatively mediocre.

I've tested quite a few AI-powered PPT generation tools before, and currently, Gemini offers the best overall performance.

**But it's not a magic bullet.**

Its greatest value lies in solving the "from 0 to 1" problem, helping you quickly build a framework and generate a first draft.

As for "polishing from an 80 to a 95," you still need to rely on yourself to adjust the content and optimize the design.

It's a good tool, but its effectiveness depends on how you use it.

One thing is certain: **The barrier to creating PPTs has been completely leveled.**
