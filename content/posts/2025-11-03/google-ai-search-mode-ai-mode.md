AI Mode has various functional characteristics, including:

## 1. Multimodal Input
Users can input search queries through various methods such as voice, text, and images. The search engine automatically decomposes query intent and generates corresponding answers. This applies to various life scenarios, such as creating travel itineraries, shopping suggestions, programming guides, etc.

## 2. Deep Search
AI Mode can initiate hundreds of searches, integrate information across different fields, and generate compelling expert-level reports, thereby saving manual research time.

## 3. Real-time Interactive Search
Based on Gemini models and Live API technology, users can click the "Live" icon in the interface and use their phone camera to ask questions about real-world scenes. The AI system can understand the visual content in real-time and respond verbally, while also providing relevant resource links.

## 4. Smart Shopping Experience
AI Mode can help users browse clothing, compare products, and virtually try on outfits. With user permission, it can also complete purchases through Google Pay when prices drop.

## 5. Personalized Recommendations
AI Mode combines personal data such as Gmail, previous search history, and booking information to provide users with more personalized recommendations. For example, recommending destination cuisine and music activities based on travel plans.

## 6. Custom Charts and Graphics
For queries involving statistical data or data comparisons, such as sports match results or financial trends, AI Mode can create intuitive visual charts and interactive graphics.
