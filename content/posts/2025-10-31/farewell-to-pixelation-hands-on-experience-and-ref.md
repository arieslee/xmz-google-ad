# Farewell to Mosaics: Practical Experience and Insights on Enhancing Video Quality with Video2x

As a user with a special affection for old animations and low-resolution game recordings, I have long been searching for an effective way to enhance video quality. That search ended when I discovered Video2x—an open-source tool for AI-driven deep learning-based lossless video upscaling and frame rate enhancement. After using it extensively for a while, I want to share my experience to provide reference for others with similar needs.

## First Impression: Open-Source, Powerful, and "Hardcore"

Video2x’s GitHub page exudes the vibe of a "professional tool." Unlike some commercial software that offers sleek interfaces and one-click installation, it clearly lists its core dependencies: FFmpeg, Python, and powerful image upscaling algorithms (such as waifu2x, SRMD, and Real-ESRGAN).

Its core functions are highly focused:



* Video Upscaling: Convert low-resolution videos (e.g., 480p) to high-resolution (e.g., 1080p or 4K). It uses AI models to intelligently fill in details, reducing jagged edges and blurriness.

* Frame Rate Enhancement: Through frame interpolation technology (e.g., RIFE algorithm), convert low-frame-rate videos (e.g., 24fps) to high-frame-rate ones (e.g., 60fps) for smoother motion.

This no-frills, function-first style immediately sparked my interest as a tech enthusiast.

## Practical Experience: From Installation to Output

Using Video2x felt like a "battle" with command lines and dependencies, but the final results made every effort worthwhile.

### 1. Installation & Configuration: The Biggest Hurdle

For users unfamiliar with Python and command-line environments, installation can be the biggest challenge. You need to:



* Install Python and FFmpeg correctly, and ensure they are added to the system environment variables.

* Install dependencies corresponding to your chosen upscaling algorithm (e.g., PyTorch, NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for GPU acceleration).

* Install Video2x via pip.

While the official documentation is detailed, any mistake in the process can cause failures for beginners. I strongly recommend verifying that your graphics card driver and CUDA environment are working properly before starting.

### 2. Usage Process: The Art of Command Lines

Video2x is mainly operated via command lines. A typical upscaling command looks like this:



```
video2x --input video.mp4 --output video\_1080p.mp4 --width 1920 --height 1080 --method waifu2x
```

The process is fully transparent: you can see it first extract frames from the video into images, then use the AI model to upscale each image, and finally re-encode the processed image sequence into a video.

#### My Practical Case:

I selected a 10-year-old 720p animation video, with the goal of upscaling it to 1080p.



* Hardware: NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU

* Algorithm: waifu2x (excellent performance for anime content)

Experience: After launching the command, GPU usage spiked to 100% instantly, and the fan started roaring. Logs scrolled rapidly in the command-line window, showing the progress of processing each frame. The process was quite time-consuming—a 5-minute video took nearly 1 hour to complete. This made me deeply understand the meaning of "computational cost": high-quality output comes at the expense of significant computing power and time.

### 3. Effect Evaluation: Amazing "Rebirth" of Details

When I played the processed video, I was truly impressed.



* Line Processing: Originally blurry and jagged edges became extremely clear and smooth. The AI seemed to "understand" that these lines should be smooth and reconstructed them perfectly.

* Texture Details: In areas like character hair and clothing, textures that were once a blurry mess revealed more distinguishable details. The AI did not simply sharpen the image, but intelligently "created" reasonable textures.

* Noise Control: Compression noise and film grain in the original video were effectively suppressed after upscaling, resulting in a much cleaner image.

Of course, it is not perfect. In some extremely complex scenes or those with heavily blurred backgrounds, the AI may "overperform" and generate unrealistic textures (commonly known as "plastic-like artifacts"). However, for most cases—especially anime and cartoon content—the enhancement effect is transformative.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

### Advantages



* Outstanding Effect: On suitable materials, the quality improvement far surpasses traditional interpolation algorithms.

* Completely Free & Open-Source: No feature restrictions, an active community, and continuous updates.

* High Customization: Supports multiple advanced AI models, allowing users to choose the best algorithm for different types of videos.

* Transparent & Controllable: The entire processing workflow is clear, making it suitable for tech enthusiasts to study and debug.

### Disadvantages



* High Learning Curve: Unfriendly to beginners and requires a certain technical background.

* Slow Processing Speed: Extremely resource-intensive; processing long videos requires great patience (almost unfeasible without a high-performance NVIDIA graphics card).

* High Memory Usage: Upscaling high-resolution videos consumes a great deal of video memory, which can easily lead to memory overflow.

* Not Universal: Its effect on live-action videos (especially old live-action films) may be worse than on anime, and it may sometimes introduce unnatural artifacts.

## Conclusion & Reflections

Video2x is not a "Meitu Xiuxiu" (simple photo-editing app) designed for ordinary users; it is more like a "Swiss Army knife" for geeks and video processing enthusiasts. It allowed me to truly experience the power of AI in computer vision—moving from "repairing" to "understanding and reconstructing."

Using it felt like engaging in "digital archaeology." You feed a low-resolution video full of nostalgic marks into it, and after hours of "computational alchemy," it is reborn to meet the standards of modern display devices. The sense of surprise after waiting is something no one-click software can provide.

## Advice for Potential Users



* If you are an anime enthusiast with a decent NVIDIA graphics card and are not afraid of command lines, Video2x is definitely worth the effort—it will bring you great rewards.

* If you only process videos occasionally or prioritize ease of use, commercial software with similar AI features (e.g., Topaz Video AI) may be a better choice, though they are quite expensive.

* If you are a tech enthusiast, Video2x is an excellent platform for learning and practice, allowing you to gain in-depth knowledge of the entire AI super-resolution pipeline.

In short, Video2x showed me the perfect combination of open-source communities and AI technology. It may be a bit "hardcore," but the world behind that door is incredibly wonderful.
