## 1. What is DeepSite?

DeepSite is an online development tool based on the DeepSeek-V3 model that allows users to quickly generate code for games, applications, or web pages by simply entering requirements directly in a web browser, without configuring environments or installing any software.

The tool supports various task types, including generating simple games (like Snake, Brick Breaker), visual effects (like fireworks, code rain), and functional web pages (such as image background removal, personal websites), providing developers with an out-of-the-box rapid development experience.

### Key Features of DeepSite
- **Rapid Code Generation**: Automatically generates project code for games, web pages, applications, and more by inputting prompts
- **Real-Time Preview**: View rendering effects in real-time during code generation, supporting WYSIWYG adjustments
- **Multi-Task Support**: Covers diverse needs including game development, web creation, and special effects generation
- **Zero Environment Dependencies**: Runs entirely in the browser, requiring no installation of development environments or tools

### Technical Principles of DeepSite
- **Deep Learning Model**: Based on the DeepSeek-V3 large model, trained on massive code datasets for accurate text-to-code conversion
- **NLP Technology**: Parses natural language requirements and converts them into structured instructions understandable by the model
- **Real-Time Rendering Engine**: Uses front-end technology stacks to achieve synchronous updates between code generation and effect preview

## 2. Core Features & Tutorials

### 2.1 Basic Operations: 3 Steps to Generate Applications

#### Step ①: Input Natural Language Instructions
Use the input box in the lower left corner of the interface to describe requirements using the **"Function + Scenario + Details"** structure:

• **Games**: `Generate a cyberpunk-style ping pong game with explosion effects, supporting two-player mode`

![2.png](/images/uploads/editor-1761966728228.png)

• **Applications**: `Create a chat interface similar to WeChat, including message list and send box`

![3.png](/images/uploads/editor-1761966757397.png)

• **Web Pages**: `Design an artistic blog webpage with login and registration features, and article categories`

#### Step ②: Real-Time Debugging & Iteration
The system generates code within 10 seconds (such as Gomoku game code), with a preview of the running effect on the right side. If unsatisfied, add optimization instructions (different optimization instructions produce different effects - use your own prompt methods to find your preferred style):

• `Change the background to a starry sky gradient`

• `Increase the difficulty level of the AI opponent`

• `Add a score leaderboard feature`

### 2.2 Advanced Techniques: From Creativity to Commercialization

#### Technique ①: Cross-Border Artistic Fusion
Generate unique designs through **"style fusion instructions"**:

• `Ukiyo-e style spaceship incorporating Katsushika Hokusai's wave textures, astronaut wearing kimono operating console`

• `Steampunk + ink wash painting style RPG game character, mechanical arm with glowing runes`

#### Technique ②: Dynamic Interactive Technology
Add dynamic instructions after uploading design mockups:

• `Make the photographer walk into the living room design and high-five, generating storyboard animation`

• `Add flock of birds flying around effect in the 3D flight simulator`

#### Technique ③: Precise Parameter Control
For professional developers, use parameterized instructions:

• `Generate 16-element grid: 1. Pantone 2024 Color of the Year #4A6F34; 2. Morandi gray diamond... spacing error < 0.1%`

## 4. Pitfall Avoidance Guide & Tips

### 1. Chinese Optimization Strategy
- When involving text, add English keywords to improve clarity (e.g., `Chinese text "Money"`)
- For complex layouts, consider generating the base then adding text using PS

### 2. Copyright Avoidance Techniques
- Use `Makoto Shinkai + Van Gogh brushstrokes` instead of directly imitating living artists
- For commercial projects, consider overlaying handwritten fonts and paper textures to reduce AI appearance

### 3. Long Project Development Strategy
- Generate by blocks: `First generate e-commerce product page, then shopping cart module, finally stitch code together`
- Break down complex functions into multiple iterations: `First implement user registration → add payment interface → integrate logistics tracking`
