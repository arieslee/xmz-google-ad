Today, I'm sharing a game-changing tool that can double your development efficiency – Chef.

It claims to be "the only AI app builder that understands backend." That sounds like a bold statement, but after trying it, I found it truly delivers.

Unlike the common frontend UI generators we often use, Chef's real power lies in bundling complex backend services – **database, file uploads, real-time interfaces, background tasks** – right out of the box. Think of it as an AI assistant that handles the heavy lifting across both frontend and backend for your application.

It's particularly ideal for:
- Quickly building prototypes or MVPs without starting from scratch with servers and databases.
- Using AI to generate interfaces and logic, while needing a stable and reliable data layer for support.
- Drastically reducing time spent on integration between frontend, backend, and databases.

Built on Convex, it ensures reliable data real-time synchronization and backend task scheduling. Plus, it offers both local runtime and private deployment options. You can start by building a small project on your own machine to test the waters before diving in deeper.
