If a voice model requires no GPU, yet combines compact size with real-time voice cloning capabilities, it can only be the newly released open-source project NeuTTS Air . In a short time, it has not only gained over 3K stars but also claimed the top spot on Hugging Face Trending.

Built on the Kua 0.5B model and integrated with a self-developed neural audio codecNeuTTS Air L significantly reduces memory and computational resource usage while maintaining sound quality. It achieves the most human-like voice naturalness among models of similar size, emphasizing features such as small size, 3-second instant voice cloning, and highly realistic voice output.

Whether on mobile phones, computers, or Raspberry Pi, it runs smoothly without compatibility issues, making it highly suitable for embedded voice assistants, voice-enabled toys, offline applications, and similar scenarios.
