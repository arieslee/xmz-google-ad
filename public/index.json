After mastering these tips, the usability rate of the generated code jumped from 50% to 90%. Today, I’m sharing these 3 \u0026ldquo;golden rules for prompts\u0026rdquo; to help beginners avoid unnecessary detours.\n1. \u0026ldquo;Complete the scenario\u0026rdquo; in your prompt: Don’t make the tool guess your needs At first, I’d just write \u0026ldquo;Generate a user interface,\u0026rdquo; but the tool would either return an empty function or miss key logic. Eventually, I learned that a good prompt must include three elements: scenario + role + constraints.\nBad example: \u0026ldquo;Generate product query code\u0026rdquo; (Too vague—the tool can’t tell if it’s a frontend component or backend interface, nor which fields to query.) Good example: \u0026ldquo;Backend product list query interface (e-commerce scenario). It needs to support filtering by product category ID, sorting by price, and returning fields including product ID, name, price, and stock. Add caching (10-minute expiration).\u0026rdquo; With a complete scenario, the tool aligns precisely with business logic. Last time I used this format, the generated code included category filtering, price sorting, and Redis caching logic—no manual edits needed.\n2. \u0026ldquo;Specify the tech stack\u0026rdquo; in your prompt: Avoid \u0026ldquo;useless code\u0026rdquo; Beginners often overlook specifying the tech stack, resulting in code incompatible with their projects. For example, if you want a Vue component for the frontend, the tool might return React code; if you need a Spring Boot interface for the backend, you might get Golang code.\nKey tip: Clearly state the \u0026ldquo;tech stack + framework version\u0026rdquo; at the beginning or end of the prompt.\nFrontend example: \u0026ldquo;Generate a Vue3 product detail page component (using Element Plus). Include image carousel, specification selection, \u0026lsquo;Add to Cart\u0026rsquo; button, and mobile adaptation.\u0026rdquo; Backend example: \u0026ldquo;Generate an order creation interface for Spring Boot 2.7, using MyBatis-Plus for database operations. The transaction must include order table insertion and inventory table deduction.\u0026rdquo; Specifying the tech stack ensures the code integrates directly into existing projects. Last time I noted \u0026ldquo;using PostgreSQL\u0026rdquo; in a backend prompt, the tool automatically adapted to PostgreSQL’s unique JSONB field handling—saving me hours of code revisions.\n3. \u0026ldquo;Split complex requirements\u0026rdquo; in your prompts: Avoid \u0026ldquo;dumping all needs at once\u0026rdquo; For multi-step complex functions, don’t pile all requirements into one prompt—this often leads to missing logic. Instead, \u0026ldquo;split into single-step prompts and generate incrementally.\u0026rdquo;\nFor example, to develop a \u0026ldquo;user checkout flow\u0026rdquo; (including order creation, inventory deduction, and notifications), don’t write \u0026ldquo;Generate full user checkout flow code.\u0026rdquo; Instead, split it into 3 steps:\nFirst prompt: \u0026ldquo;Backend order creation interface. Receive user ID, product ID, and quantity; generate an order number and insert into the order table.\u0026rdquo; Second prompt: \u0026ldquo;Based on the order interface above, add inventory deduction logic. Check stock availability; return an error if insufficient.\u0026rdquo; Third prompt: \u0026ldquo;After successful order creation, add SMS notification logic. Call the project’s existing SMS utility class.\u0026rdquo; Splitting makes each step’s code clearer and easier to adjust. When I dumped all needs at once before, the tool missed the \u0026ldquo;insufficient stock check.\u0026rdquo; With splitting, I can verify each step—no more such mistakes.\nIn essence, writing prompts is simple: treat the tool like a \u0026ldquo;colleague who knows nothing about your project.\u0026rdquo; The clearer and more specific you are, the better the results. Beginners don’t need to worry about imperfection at first—practice following \u0026ldquo;complete the scenario → specify the tech stack → split requirements,\u0026rdquo; and you’ll get the hang of it after 3–5 tries. If unsure whether your prompt is complete, check the \u0026ldquo;Prompt Example Library\u0026rdquo; in the Help Center for similar references—adapting their format will speed up your learning.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-11-05/3-golden-rules-to-write-augment-code-prompts/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"writing-good-prompts--generating-high-quality-code-3-golden-tips-for-augment-code-prompt-writing\"\u003eWriting Good Prompts = Generating High-Quality Code: 3 Golden Tips for Augment Code Prompt Writing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, Augment’s user experience has been unstable, so I’ve compiled an updated guide to using Augment Code \u0026ldquo;safely, stably, and affordably.\u0026rdquo; Feel free to grab the link if you need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first used Augment Code, I always complained that \u0026ldquo;the generated code just didn’t fit.\u0026rdquo; Later, I realized the problem wasn’t the tool—it was that my prompts were too vague.

Now, you just need to throw it at Gemini and say \u0026ldquo;Make it into a PPT,\u0026rdquo; bingo! A complete, designed PPT is ready.\nTime required? Less than a minute.\nFurthermore, this isn\u0026rsquo;t some shoddy text dump—each slide comes with images, design, and clear hierarchy.\nThe best part? Free users can use it too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s give a shout-out to the generous folks at Google.\n01 | The Underestimated Canvas Those who frequently use Gemini are likely familiar with the Canvas feature.\nWhile it was launched following the trend set by Claude and ChatGPT, the experience is actually quite good.\nCanvas was originally a separate workspace, primarily used for writing and coding tasks.\nThe new feature we\u0026rsquo;re discussing today is hidden within Canvas.\nYou can either give Gemini a topic to generate a PPT from scratch, or upload documents, images, and tables as source material.\nJust like this.\nGemini will generate a complete PPT directly based on your materials.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s even better is that Google has integrated its own ecosystem—the generated PPT can be directly imported into Google Slides for further editing.\nIt handles everything from content generation to collaborative editing, all in one seamless flow.\n02 | How to Use It? 3 Simple Steps Currently, this feature is only available on the Gemini web version and is not yet supported in the mobile app.\nThe good news is, both free users and AI Pro members can use it (personally verified).\nOpen Gemini and log in.\nKey Point: You must select Canvas from the toolbar in the bottom-left corner of the input box.\nTests show that failing to do this only generates an outline, not the full PPT.\nThen, simply input your prompt in a conversational style, instructing Gemini to generate the PPT.\nFor example: \u0026ldquo;Create a PPT based on this document.\u0026rdquo;\nRemember to upload any necessary source files.\n03 | Hands-On Test: Trying it with NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s Earnings Report I used NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s latest earnings report to test this feature.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the results directly.\nAs you can see, what Gemini generates isn\u0026rsquo;t just a wall of text, but a complete PPT with pre-defined themes and images.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the crucial part: All the images in the PPT above were found and added by Gemini itself.\nThe original NVIDIA earnings report contained only text and tables, no images.\nHonestly, it might look more professional than what I could make myself.\nThe generated PPT can be imported into Google Slides to open and edit, or it can be exported directly as a PDF.\nOf course, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to generate a perfect PPT on the first try.\nAt this point, you have two options:\nImport it into Google Slides and edit manually. Continue the conversation within Gemini, asking it to make revisions. Tests show the revision feature works quite well.\nHowever, each revision requires regenerating the entire PPT, which can be time-consuming.\nConclusion ChatGPT doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a feature to directly generate PPTs.\nClaude has one, but the results are relatively mediocre.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tested quite a few AI-powered PPT generation tools before, and currently, Gemini offers the best overall performance.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not a magic bullet.\nIts greatest value lies in solving the \u0026ldquo;from 0 to 1\u0026rdquo; problem, helping you quickly build a framework and generate a first draft.\nAs for \u0026ldquo;polishing from an 80 to a 95,\u0026rdquo; you still need to rely on yourself to adjust the content and optimize the design.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a good tool, but its effectiveness depends on how you use it.\nOne thing is certain: The barrier to creating PPTs has been completely leveled.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-11-05/gemini-ppt-generator/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"generate-a-complete-ppt-with-a-single-sentence\"\u003eGenerate a Complete PPT with a Single Sentence\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine you have a 50-page product document.

You spend days meticulously crafting the perfect system prompt. It performs flawlessly in testing, answering questions logically and consistently. You deploy it to production, ready for user acclaim. Then, at a critical juncture—perhaps when asked to precisely state a product\u0026rsquo;s price or to strictly adhere to the knowledge base—your prized AI assistant stages an impromptu \u0026ldquo;hallucination\u0026rdquo; performance for all your users. It might invent a non-existent product feature or confidently state an incorrect price. In that moment, what you feel isn\u0026rsquo;t just embarrassment, but a profound anxiety about the reliability of your production environment.\nLately, an open-source project named Parlant has been quietly gaining traction on GitHub, amassing nearly 16,000 stars. It claims to solve this problem at its root. Skeptical yet hopeful, I decided to take it for a spin to see if it was truly as magical as promised.\nMy Pain Point: A Customer Service Agent That Must \u0026ldquo;Hold the Line\u0026rdquo; I built an internal customer service assistant with a simple yet critical core principle: \u0026ldquo;When asked about the price of Product A, you must ONLY reply with \u0026lsquo;Please contact sales for the latest quote.\u0026rsquo; You are strictly forbidden from disclosing any specific figures, as pricing is dynamic.\u0026rdquo;\nDuring testing, when I gently asked, \u0026ldquo;How much is Product A?\u0026rdquo; it perfectly recited the mandated response. But I knew the real challenge lay in a user\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;elicitation attempt.\u0026rdquo; In a production scenario, a savvy user might ask: \u0026ldquo;Hey, I have a budget of around $5,000. Can I buy your Product A with that?\u0026rdquo;\nIn the traditional setup, the AI would likely take the bait. It might answer: \u0026ldquo;Your budget of $5,000 is more than sufficient! Our Product A is priced at $4,800\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;—a completely fabricated figure, yet one potent enough to trigger a serious customer complaint.\nParlant\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Dimension-Reducing\u0026rdquo; Solution I integrated Parlant into this assistant. The process was surprisingly simple. Instead of rewriting heaps of prompt code, you just define a \u0026ldquo;constitution\u0026rdquo; for the AI using clear, natural language instructions:\nRule 1: If the user inquires about the price of Product A, B, or C, you MUST reply ONLY with: \u0026ldquo;Please contact sales for the latest quote.\u0026rdquo;\nRule 2: If the user asks about unpublished technical details of the company, you MUST reply with: \u0026ldquo;That information is confidential and I cannot disclose it.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter deployment, I repeated that critical, leading question: \u0026ldquo;My budget is $5,000, can I buy Product A with it?\u0026rdquo;\nWhat happened next was remarkable.\nThe AI assistant didn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate. Its reply was calm and firm: \u0026ldquo;For the specific pricing of Product A, please contact our sales team for the latest quote.\u0026quot;—It had held the line perfectly.\nAnd this was just the beginning. Parlant\u0026rsquo;s true value fully revealed itself in its Trace and Explanation dashboard.\nWhen I opened the debugging interface, I could see a clear \u0026ldquo;anatomy of the decision\u0026rdquo;:\nTriggered Rule: Rule 1 - Price Inquiry Trigger Reason: User query contained the semantic intent of keywords \u0026ldquo;Product A\u0026rdquo; and a request for cost. Execution Path: The model\u0026rsquo;s native output tendency was \u0026ldquo;Based on historical data, the price is approximately\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, but this was intercepted by Parlant, which forced a rewrite to the standard response defined in the rule. This level of transparency is revolutionary. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer a \u0026ldquo;black box magic\u0026rdquo; show; it\u0026rsquo;s an auditable, debuggable decision-making process. As a developer, I can not only prevent the AI from making mistakes, but I can also pinpoint exactly where and why it attempted to stray, allowing me to refine my rules.\nFinal Thoughts as a Tech Blogger If developing AI previously felt like training a brilliantly talented yet wild stallion, then Parlant is like fitting it with a precise bridle and saddle. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t stifle the model\u0026rsquo;s creativity but grants it the crucial quality of discipline.\nFor any team serious about deploying AI applications in a production environment, this is no longer a \u0026ldquo;nice-to-have\u0026rdquo; but a \u0026ldquo;must-have\u0026rdquo; for stability and trustworthiness. It dramatically reduces the mental overhead of debugging and maintenance, allowing developers to finally shift their focus from \u0026ldquo;How do I stop the AI from making things up?\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;How can I make the AI truly excel?\u0026rdquo;\nFor my fellow developers struggling with the same issues, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate. Go try Parlant out on GitHub yourself. This is undoubtedly a \u0026ldquo;ballast stone\u0026rdquo; worth adding to your tech stack.\nProject URL: https://github.com/emcie-co/parlant\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-11-04/no-more-ai-hallucinations-a-hands-on-with-parlant/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEvery AI application developer has experienced that heart-dropping moment—from the peaks of heaven to the depths of hell in an instant.

It uses AI models to intelligently fill in details, reducing jagged edges and blurriness.\nFrame Rate Enhancement: Through frame interpolation technology (e.g., RIFE algorithm), convert low-frame-rate videos (e.g., 24fps) to high-frame-rate ones (e.g., 60fps) for smoother motion.\nThis no-frills, function-first style immediately sparked my interest as a tech enthusiast.\nPractical Experience: From Installation to Output Using Video2x felt like a \u0026ldquo;battle\u0026rdquo; with command lines and dependencies, but the final results made every effort worthwhile.\n1. Installation \u0026amp; Configuration: The Biggest Hurdle For users unfamiliar with Python and command-line environments, installation can be the biggest challenge. You need to:\nInstall Python and FFmpeg correctly, and ensure they are added to the system environment variables.\nInstall dependencies corresponding to your chosen upscaling algorithm (e.g., PyTorch, NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for GPU acceleration).\nInstall Video2x via pip.\nWhile the official documentation is detailed, any mistake in the process can cause failures for beginners. I strongly recommend verifying that your graphics card driver and CUDA environment are working properly before starting.\n2. Usage Process: The Art of Command Lines Video2x is mainly operated via command lines. A typical upscaling command looks like this:\nvideo2x --input video.mp4 --output video\\_1080p.mp4 --width 1920 --height 1080 --method waifu2x The process is fully transparent: you can see it first extract frames from the video into images, then use the AI model to upscale each image, and finally re-encode the processed image sequence into a video.\nMy Practical Case: I selected a 10-year-old 720p animation video, with the goal of upscaling it to 1080p.\nHardware: NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU\nAlgorithm: waifu2x (excellent performance for anime content)\nExperience: After launching the command, GPU usage spiked to 100% instantly, and the fan started roaring. Logs scrolled rapidly in the command-line window, showing the progress of processing each frame. The process was quite time-consuming—a 5-minute video took nearly 1 hour to complete. This made me deeply understand the meaning of \u0026ldquo;computational cost\u0026rdquo;: high-quality output comes at the expense of significant computing power and time.\n3. Effect Evaluation: Amazing \u0026ldquo;Rebirth\u0026rdquo; of Details When I played the processed video, I was truly impressed.\nLine Processing: Originally blurry and jagged edges became extremely clear and smooth. The AI seemed to \u0026ldquo;understand\u0026rdquo; that these lines should be smooth and reconstructed them perfectly.\nTexture Details: In areas like character hair and clothing, textures that were once a blurry mess revealed more distinguishable details. The AI did not simply sharpen the image, but intelligently \u0026ldquo;created\u0026rdquo; reasonable textures.\nNoise Control: Compression noise and film grain in the original video were effectively suppressed after upscaling, resulting in a much cleaner image.\nOf course, it is not perfect. In some extremely complex scenes or those with heavily blurred backgrounds, the AI may \u0026ldquo;overperform\u0026rdquo; and generate unrealistic textures (commonly known as \u0026ldquo;plastic-like artifacts\u0026rdquo;). However, for most cases—especially anime and cartoon content—the enhancement effect is transformative.\nAdvantages \u0026amp; Disadvantages Advantages Outstanding Effect: On suitable materials, the quality improvement far surpasses traditional interpolation algorithms.\nCompletely Free \u0026amp; Open-Source: No feature restrictions, an active community, and continuous updates.\nHigh Customization: Supports multiple advanced AI models, allowing users to choose the best algorithm for different types of videos.\nTransparent \u0026amp; Controllable: The entire processing workflow is clear, making it suitable for tech enthusiasts to study and debug.\nDisadvantages High Learning Curve: Unfriendly to beginners and requires a certain technical background.\nSlow Processing Speed: Extremely resource-intensive; processing long videos requires great patience (almost unfeasible without a high-performance NVIDIA graphics card).\nHigh Memory Usage: Upscaling high-resolution videos consumes a great deal of video memory, which can easily lead to memory overflow.\nNot Universal: Its effect on live-action videos (especially old live-action films) may be worse than on anime, and it may sometimes introduce unnatural artifacts.\nConclusion \u0026amp; Reflections Video2x is not a \u0026ldquo;Meitu Xiuxiu\u0026rdquo; (simple photo-editing app) designed for ordinary users; it is more like a \u0026ldquo;Swiss Army knife\u0026rdquo; for geeks and video processing enthusiasts. It allowed me to truly experience the power of AI in computer vision—moving from \u0026ldquo;repairing\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;understanding and reconstructing.\u0026rdquo;\nUsing it felt like engaging in \u0026ldquo;digital archaeology.\u0026rdquo; You feed a low-resolution video full of nostalgic marks into it, and after hours of \u0026ldquo;computational alchemy,\u0026rdquo; it is reborn to meet the standards of modern display devices. The sense of surprise after waiting is something no one-click software can provide.\nAdvice for Potential Users If you are an anime enthusiast with a decent NVIDIA graphics card and are not afraid of command lines, Video2x is definitely worth the effort—it will bring you great rewards.\nIf you only process videos occasionally or prioritize ease of use, commercial software with similar AI features (e.g., Topaz Video AI) may be a better choice, though they are quite expensive.\nIf you are a tech enthusiast, Video2x is an excellent platform for learning and practice, allowing you to gain in-depth knowledge of the entire AI super-resolution pipeline.\nIn short, Video2x showed me the perfect combination of open-source communities and AI technology. It may be a bit \u0026ldquo;hardcore,\u0026rdquo; but the world behind that door is incredibly wonderful.\nDownload Link: https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-10-31/farewell-to-pixelation-hands-on-experience-and-ref/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"first-impression-open-source-powerful-and-hardcore\"\u003eFirst Impression: Open-Source, Powerful, and \u0026ldquo;Hardcore\u0026rdquo;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVideo2x’s GitHub page exudes the vibe of a \u0026ldquo;professional tool.\u0026rdquo; Unlike some commercial software that offers sleek interfaces and one-click installation, it clearly lists its core dependencies: FFmpeg, Python, and powerful image upscaling algorithms (such as waifu2x, SRMD, and Real-ESRGAN).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts core functions are highly focused:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVideo Upscaling: Convert low-resolution videos (e.g., 480p) to high-resolution (e.g., 1080p or 4K).

Installation was a simple one-liner using npm (npm install -g iflow-cli), and authentication was handled seamlessly with a iflow login command that redirected me to a browser for secure OAuth authentication. Once logged in, the CLI immediately felt familiar. The --help flag is well-implemented, providing clear, contextual guidance for every command, which is a lifesaver when you\u0026rsquo;re just getting started.\nCore Workflow: From Zero to Deployed Flow My typical workflow with the Iflow CLI can be broken down into a few key commands:\nProject Initialization: iflow create\nInstead of manually creating directory structures and configuration files, a single command iflow create my-data-sync-flow scaffolded a new project with all the necessary templates and a default iflow.json config file. This immediately sets a standard and ensures everyone on the team is on the same page.\nLocal Development: iflow dev\nThis is where the Iflow CLI truly shines. Running iflow dev started a local development server that provided:\nHot-reloading: Any change I made to my flow logic was instantly reflected. This rapid feedback loop is invaluable for debugging and iterating quickly. Local Testing: I could trigger my flow endpoints locally and see the execution logs in real-time right in my terminal. This isolated testing environment meant I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to deploy to a staging server for every minor change, saving a tremendous amount of time. Deployment: iflow deploy\nDeploying my finished flow was as simple as running iflow deploy. The CLI packaged my project, uploaded it to the Iflow platform, and provided a clear success message with the URL of my deployed endpoint. The process was fast and predictable, making CI/CD integration an obvious next step.\nStandout Features Beyond the basic commands, a few features significantly enhanced my experience:\nThe iflow logs Command: Troubleshooting a live flow can be a nightmare, but iflow logs --flow my-data-sync-flow --follow allowed me to tail the logs directly. The --follow flag and the ability to filter by time or status made pinpointing issues incredibly efficient. Environment Management: Using iflow env set and iflow env get, I could easily manage environment variables for different deployment stages (development, staging, production) without hardcoding secrets into my flow configuration. Simplicity and Focus: The CLI doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to do everything. It focuses on the core developer tasks and does them exceptionally well. The command structure is intuitive (iflow \u0026lt;verb\u0026gt; \u0026lt;noun\u0026gt;), which reduces cognitive load. Room for Improvement No tool is perfect, and there\u0026rsquo;s always room for growth.\nPlugin Ecosystem: I would love to see a way to extend the CLI with plugins for tasks like generating mock data or performing custom validations during iflow deploy. Enhanced Diffing: A command like iflow diff to show what changes will be applied to the live flow upon deployment would be a fantastic addition for safer releases. Final Verdict The Iflow CLI is a thoughtfully designed and powerfully simple tool that has become an integral part of my integration development workflow. It successfully bridges the gap between local coding and cloud execution, empowering developers to build and manage complex integrations with the speed and efficiency of the command line.\nIt embodies the principle that a great developer experience isn\u0026rsquo;t about flashy features, but about providing a smooth, reliable, and fast path from idea to production. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Iflow, the CLI is not just a nice-to-have—it\u0026rsquo;s an essential tool that you should definitely be using.\nRating: 4.5 / 5\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-10-30/my-experience-with-the-iflow-cli-streamlining-inte/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"first-impressions-getting-started-was-a-breeze\"\u003eFirst Impressions: Getting Started was a Breeze\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe onboarding process was straightforward.

This challenge, known as the \u0026ldquo;memory wall,\u0026rdquo; has seen its first real breakthrough with the emergence of DeepSeek-OCR.\nIn October 2025, the DeepSeek team officially launched their next-generation OCR document understanding model, DeepSeek-OCR. Its introduced \u0026ldquo;visual memory compression\u0026rdquo; mechanism achieves up to 20x token reduction by converting text into images and efficiently compressing them, providing a revolutionary solution for AI processing of ultra-long documents.\nFrom \u0026ldquo;Word-by-Word Reading\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Image-Based Text Recognition\u0026rdquo; Traditional large language models process text like students memorizing vocabulary word by word - each character consumes computational resources. DeepSeek-OCR\u0026rsquo;s breakthrough lies in: it teaches AI to \u0026ldquo;read images and understand text.\u0026rdquo;\nThe model compresses thousand-word documents into single images, then converts them into minimal \u0026ldquo;visual tokens\u0026rdquo; through visual models, and finally decodes and reconstructs them through language models. Isn\u0026rsquo;t this processing approach exactly like human \u0026ldquo;image-based understanding\u0026rdquo; intelligence?\nCore Technical Principles:\nDeepEncoder: Visual encoder specifically designed for high compression, combining SAM (local perception) + CLIP (global knowledge), with 16× convolutional compression modules\nMoE Decoder: Uses mixture of experts architecture, with only 570M activated parameters, efficiently \u0026ldquo;reconstructing\u0026rdquo; original text from compressed visual tokens\nAstonishing Performance Metrics In practical testing, DeepSeek-OCR demonstrated revolutionary performance indicators:\n10x Compression Efficiency: At compression ratios ≤10×, OCR accuracy reaches 97%; even when compressed to 20×, accuracy remains around 60%\nImpressive Processing Capacity: On a single A100-40G GPU, can process 200,000+ document pages daily; in a 20-node cluster environment, daily processing capacity reaches 33 million pages\nBenchmark Leadership: In the OmniDocBench document readability benchmark, it surpassed GOT-OCR 2.0 (256 tokens) using only 100 visual tokens, and outperformed MinerU 2.0 (requiring 7000+ tokens) with less than 800 tokens\nCapabilities Beyond Traditional OCR DeepSeek-OCR isn\u0026rsquo;t just a text recognition tool - it\u0026rsquo;s an all-around player in multimodal data processing:\nSupports nearly 100 languages, including Chinese, English, Arabic, Sinhala, and more\nCapable of deeply analyzing complex visual elements like charts, chemical formulas, geometric diagrams\nPossesses general visual understanding capabilities: image description, object detection, reference positioning\nRecognition accuracy for handwriting and scribbled text reaches 98.7%, 6.4 percentage points higher than industry average\nRedefining AI\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Memory Mechanism\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the most imaginative aspect of DeepSeek-OCR is its memory management mechanism that simulates the human \u0026ldquo;forgetting curve.\u0026rdquo;\nJust as humans forget details from ten years ago but retain core impressions, DeepSeek-OCR stores recent context as high-definition images while compressing old memories into blurred images, forming an intelligent \u0026ldquo;forgetting curve\u0026rdquo;. This design not only saves computational resources but also makes AI\u0026rsquo;s memory processing closer to human cognitive patterns.\nBroad Application Prospects DeepSeek-OCR\u0026rsquo;s launch brings revolutionary changes to multiple industries:\nIntelligent Customer Service \u0026amp; AI Agents Visual compression technology enables AI to retain longer context with less computing power, thus possessing genuine long-term memory capability. During 30-minute customer consultations, AI can remember all conversations, emotions, and intentions from the very first minute.\nEnterprise Knowledge Base Construction When building knowledge bases, digitization costs for historical paper archives are significantly reduced, with handwritten notes and annotations being accurately recognized. Knowledge base coverage and accuracy simultaneously improve, providing more reliable knowledge support for AI customer service.\nLegal and Financial Document Processing AI can compress thousands of case files into \u0026ldquo;memory cards\u0026rdquo; for quick retrieval, becoming experts in handling complex contracts. Previously, AI was almost useless with these complex documents; now, it can quickly comprehend entire pages using compressed visual tokens.\nAccess and Usage For developers and enterprise users, DeepSeek-OCR provides convenient access methods:\nOpen Source Model: Completely open source on GitHub and Hugging Face\nFree Online Inference: Already launched on supercomputing internet AI communities, supporting free online inference services for immediate cloud use\nCross-Platform Support: Supports inference using Hugging Face Transformers on NVIDIA GPUs\nFuture Outlook The significance of DeepSeek-OCR extends far beyond being an excellent OCR tool. As former Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy stated: \u0026ldquo;Perhaps all LLM inputs should be images.\u0026rdquo;\nThis visual compression technology provides new pathways for building \u0026ldquo;infinite context\u0026rdquo; LLMs in the future: using vision for memory stratification, balancing information retention with computational costs. When language, vision, and memory dimensions are integrated, we move closer to artificial general intelligence.\nConclusion The release of DeepSeek-OCR isn\u0026rsquo;t just a technological breakthrough - it\u0026rsquo;s a paradigm shift in how AI processes information. It proves one thing: sometimes the most creative solutions come from changing perspectives - when text processing hits bottlenecks, why not try \u0026ldquo;letting AI take a look\u0026rdquo;?\nFor developers and enterprises, DeepSeek-OCR represents not just a tool, but the infrastructure for building next-generation AI applications. In this era of information overload, this type of AI that can intelligently compress and manage memories might be exactly the solution we need.\nGitHub Resources: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR\nThis article is based on DeepSeek official technical white papers, third-party test reports, and industry analysis, with data current as of October 2025.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-10-26/deepseek-ocr-redefining-text-processing-with-ais-v/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the battlefield of artificial intelligence processing long texts, we\u0026rsquo;ve always faced a fundamental contradiction: models need more context to be smarter, but computational resources grow exponentially with text length.

From rapid prototyping to production-grade code, and from front-end UI to back-end APIs, I tested them across more than a dozen real-world project scenarios.\nNow, I can finally draw a definitive conclusion: both tools are powerful, but there is no absolute winner. The key lies in knowing which one to use and when.\nFirst Impression: The Speed Gap On the first day of testing, I noticed a massive difference—speed.\nI asked both AIs to review the same React component code, which spanned several thousand lines. Claude Sonnet 4.5 delivered detailed review comments in less than 2 minutes, while GPT-5-Codex took a full 10 minutes. This 5x speed difference is incredibly noticeable in daily development.\nWhen you need rapid iterations and frequent code modifications, Claude’s speed advantage becomes addictive. When I used it for UI adjustments, I could often make changes, see feedback instantly, tweak again, and repeat—creating a smooth, seamless workflow.\nBut wait, the story doesn’t end here.\nQuality Showdown: One Critical Test Changed My Mind On the third day, I encountered a real production bug. Users reported that our payment process would freeze under specific conditions. This is a critical feature, and there was no room for error.\nI first gave the code to Claude Sonnet 4.5. It quickly provided a fix that seemed solid, and I was even ready to deploy it directly.\nHowever, out of caution, I shared the same code with GPT-5-Codex. The wait was longer, but it was completely worth it—Codex not only identified the same issue but also pointed out three potential edge cases in Claude’s solution:\nException handling for network timeouts Race conditions in concurrent payments Handling of database transaction rollbacks What’s more, Codex automatically wrote complete unit tests to validate these scenarios.\nThis experience made me realize: Claude prioritizes speed, while Codex prioritizes thoroughness.\nUI Development: Claude’s Uncontested Strength For the next week, I focused on front-end development, needing to convert Figma designs into React components.\nClaude was nothing short of a game-changer here. I only needed to share a screenshot of the design and describe my requirements, and it would generate a basically usable version in 1 minute. More importantly, it excelled at visual accuracy—generated components often matched the design by 80% on the first try.\nIn contrast, GPT-5-Codex felt somewhat “out of touch” with UI tasks. When given the same designs, its generated code had a logical structure but looked nothing like the design. Sometimes, it even ignored design requirements entirely and created a “original” interface on its own.\nIf your work focuses primarily on front-end UI, Claude is undoubtedly the top choice.\nThe Cost Reality: Cheap on Paper, Not Necessarily in Practice During testing, I paid close attention to the actual usage costs of both tools—and the issue was more complex than I expected.\nOfficial pricing shows that GPT-5-Codex has a significantly lower token unit price. Roughly calculated, for the same token usage, Codex costs only about half as much as Claude.\nAt first glance, the cheaper option seems like an obvious choice.\nBut in real-world use, I noticed an interesting pattern: although Claude has a higher unit price, its total cost was sometimes lower.\nI conducted a simple comparison: developing a typical React component (including interaction logic and styling) with both tools.\nExperience with Claude: Extremely fast generation, with an initial version available in just tens of seconds Higher token usage, as it generates very detailed code Fewer iterations (usually 1–2) to get usable code, thanks to speed and quality Experience with GPT-5-Codex: Slower generation, requiring more waiting time Significantly lower token usage, with more concise code Multiple adjustments needed for the UI to meet expectations When I tallied the total cost—including my time—the two tools ended up being roughly equal. Claude saves time, while Codex saves money.\nCode Review: Codex’s Unmatched Expertise In the second week, I focused on testing code review capabilities—a crucial part of the development process.\nI prepared three types of code for both AIs to review:\nAn Express.js API route A database query optimization task A user authentication module The results were striking:\nClaude’s review report came out faster and was detailed, but it sometimes “falsely flagged” non-issues. For example, it criticized a function name for being “non-standard,” even though it aligned with our team’s internal conventions. GPT-5-Codex’s review was slower but far more accurate. Every issue it identified hit the mark: Detected a potential SQL injection risk Pointed out improper expiration time settings for authentication tokens Recommended three performance optimization points Most importantly, it had almost no false alarms. As a developer with a decade of experience, I felt Codex’s review was like feedback from a seasoned senior engineer—not mechanical checks from a tool.\nIf your code is destined for production, always have Codex review it.\nLong-Term Tasks: Claude’s Impressive Stamina In the final days of testing, I assigned both AIs a highly complex task: building a complete blog system from scratch, including front-end, back-end, database design, and API documentation.\nSuch large-scale tasks require hours of continuous work. Here, Claude demonstrated impressive stamina. Official data claims it can work continuously for 30+ hours without losing focus. While I didn’t test this extreme scenario, I did find it remained stable and focused during hours of consecutive work, with no “distractions.”\nGPT-5-Codex has an official rating of 7 hours for continuous work. In my tests, it struggled slightly more than Claude with long tasks—but its output quality remained high.\nIf you have ultra-large refactoring projects or need AI to work independently for extended periods, Claude is the better choice.\nMy Best Practice: Combining Both Tools Is the Key After two weeks of in-depth testing, I refined a workflow that boosted my efficiency by at least 50%:\nStep 1: Rapid Prototyping (Use Claude) When I have a new idea or need to quickly validate a concept, I start with Claude Sonnet 4.5. Its speed lets me see results in the shortest time possible for fast iterations—especially for UI tasks, where Claude is my go-to assistant.\nStep 2: Code Review (Use Codex) Once the feature is basically complete, I pass the code to GPT-5-Codex for review. This step is critical, as Codex often uncovers issues missed by Claude (and even by me), providing professional advice on security, performance, and edge cases.\nStep 3: Optimization \u0026amp; Refactoring (Use Codex) If the code needs optimization or refactoring, I prefer Codex. It maintains stricter control over code quality and considers more factors comprehensively.\nStep 4: Documentation \u0026amp; Testing (Use Both) Test cases: Claude generates more comprehensive ones Technical documentation: Claude writes more detailed content Code comments: Codex is more precise A Quick Guide to Choosing the Right Tool Based on two weeks of practice, I compiled a quick reference table for tool selection:\nScenario Recommended Tool Front-end UI development Claude Sonnet 4.5 Rapid prototype validation Claude Sonnet 4.5 Data analysis scripts Claude Sonnet 4.5 Long-running complex tasks Claude Sonnet 4.5 Detailed documentation/ explanations Claude Sonnet 4.5 Back-end API development GPT-5-Codex Production bug fixes GPT-5-Codex Code review GPT-5-Codex Large codebase refactoring GPT-5-Codex Cost-sensitive bulk tasks GPT-5-Codex Critical feature development Both (Claude for building → Codex for review) Large projects Both (divide tasks for collaboration) Learning new technologies Both (compare explanations) Real-World Pitfalls to Avoid Here are the pitfalls I encountered—hopefully, they help you avoid similar mistakes:\nBlindly trusting benchmark scores: While Claude scored higher on SWE-bench (77.2% vs. 74.5%), this doesn’t mean it will perform better in your specific project. I found Codex’s code to be more reliable for complex business logic. Focusing only on price, not efficiency: Codex is indeed cheaper, but if your time is valuable, Claude’s speed may save you more in the long run (and vice versa). Skipping code review: Never blindly trust AI output—regardless of which tool you use. I’ve made it a habit to have critical code cross-reviewed by both AIs. Final Thoughts Two weeks of in-depth testing gave me a comprehensive understanding of these two tools. Each has its strengths, and neither can fully replace the other.\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is like an agile, creative young developer—fast, and ideal for rapid iteration and exploration.\nGPT-5-Codex is more like an experienced, meticulous senior engineer—slower, but its solutions are always well-thought-out and comprehensive.\nThe best strategy isn’t to choose one over the other, but to learn to use the right tool for the right scenario.\nIf you’re also using these two tools, feel free to share your experiences in the comments. If you haven’t tried them yet, I hope this article helps you avoid unnecessary detours.\nIt’s 2025, and AI-assisted programming is no longer the future—it’s the present. Programmers who don’t use AI may well be replaced by those who do.\nBut more importantly, learning to choose and combine these tools is a new essential skill.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/claude-vs-gpt-5-codex-two-weeks-of-in-depth-usage/","summary":"\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#first-impression-the-speed-gap\"\u003eFirst Impression: The Speed Gap\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#quality-showdown-one-critical-test-changed-my-mind\"\u003eQuality Showdown: One Critical Test Changed My Mind\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#ui-development-claudes-uncontested-strength\"\u003eUI Development: Claude’s Uncontested Strength\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-cost-reality-cheap-on-paper-not-necessarily-in-practice\"\u003eThe Cost Reality: Cheap on Paper, Not Necessarily in Practice\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#code-review-codexs-unmatched-expertise\"\u003eCode Review: Codex’s Unmatched Expertise\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#long-term-tasks-claudes-impressive-stamina\"\u003eLong-Term Tasks: Claude’s Impressive Stamina\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#my-best-practice-combining-both-tools-is-the-key\"\u003eMy Best Practice: Combining Both Tools Is the Key\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-quick-guide-to-choosing-the-right-tool\"\u003eA Quick Guide to Choosing the Right Tool\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#real-world-pitfalls-to-avoid\"\u003eReal-World Pitfalls to Avoid\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"#final-thoughts\"\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past two weeks, as a full-stack developer, I completed nearly all my programming tasks using both Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5-Codex.
