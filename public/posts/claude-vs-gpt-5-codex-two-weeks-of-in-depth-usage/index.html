From rapid prototyping to production-grade code, and from front-end UI to back-end APIs, I tested them across more than a dozen real-world project scenarios.\nNow, I can finally draw a definitive conclusion: both tools are powerful, but there is no absolute winner. The key lies in knowing which one to use and when.\nFirst Impression: The Speed Gap On the first day of testing, I noticed a massive difference—speed.\nI asked both AIs to review the same React component code, which spanned several thousand lines. Claude Sonnet 4.5 delivered detailed review comments in less than 2 minutes, while GPT-5-Codex took a full 10 minutes. This 5x speed difference is incredibly noticeable in daily development.\nWhen you need rapid iterations and frequent code modifications, Claude’s speed advantage becomes addictive. When I used it for UI adjustments, I could often make changes, see feedback instantly, tweak again, and repeat—creating a smooth, seamless workflow.\nBut wait, the story doesn’t end here.\nQuality Showdown: One Critical Test Changed My Mind On the third day, I encountered a real production bug. Users reported that our payment process would freeze under specific conditions. This is a critical feature, and there was no room for error.\nI first gave the code to Claude Sonnet 4.5. It quickly provided a fix that seemed solid, and I was even ready to deploy it directly.\nHowever, out of caution, I shared the same code with GPT-5-Codex. The wait was longer, but it was completely worth it—Codex not only identified the same issue but also pointed out three potential edge cases in Claude’s solution:\nException handling for network timeouts Race conditions in concurrent payments Handling of database transaction rollbacks What’s more, Codex automatically wrote complete unit tests to validate these scenarios.\nThis experience made me realize: Claude prioritizes speed, while Codex prioritizes thoroughness.\nUI Development: Claude’s Uncontested Strength For the next week, I focused on front-end development, needing to convert Figma designs into React components.\nClaude was nothing short of a game-changer here. I only needed to share a screenshot of the design and describe my requirements, and it would generate a basically usable version in 1 minute. More importantly, it excelled at visual accuracy—generated components often matched the design by 80% on the first try.\nIn contrast, GPT-5-Codex felt somewhat “out of touch” with UI tasks. When given the same designs, its generated code had a logical structure but looked nothing like the design. Sometimes, it even ignored design requirements entirely and created a “original” interface on its own.\nIf your work focuses primarily on front-end UI, Claude is undoubtedly the top choice.\nThe Cost Reality: Cheap on Paper, Not Necessarily in Practice During testing, I paid close attention to the actual usage costs of both tools—and the issue was more complex than I expected.\nOfficial pricing shows that GPT-5-Codex has a significantly lower token unit price. Roughly calculated, for the same token usage, Codex costs only about half as much as Claude.\nAt first glance, the cheaper option seems like an obvious choice.\nBut in real-world use, I noticed an interesting pattern: although Claude has a higher unit price, its total cost was sometimes lower.\nI conducted a simple comparison: developing a typical React component (including interaction logic and styling) with both tools.\nExperience with Claude: Extremely fast generation, with an initial version available in just tens of seconds Higher token usage, as it generates very detailed code Fewer iterations (usually 1–2) to get usable code, thanks to speed and quality Experience with GPT-5-Codex: Slower generation, requiring more waiting time Significantly lower token usage, with more concise code Multiple adjustments needed for the UI to meet expectations When I tallied the total cost—including my time—the two tools ended up being roughly equal. Claude saves time, while Codex saves money.\nCode Review: Codex’s Unmatched Expertise In the second week, I focused on testing code review capabilities—a crucial part of the development process.\nI prepared three types of code for both AIs to review:\nAn Express.js API route A database query optimization task A user authentication module The results were striking:\nClaude’s review report came out faster and was detailed, but it sometimes “falsely flagged” non-issues. For example, it criticized a function name for being “non-standard,” even though it aligned with our team’s internal conventions. GPT-5-Codex’s review was slower but far more accurate. Every issue it identified hit the mark: Detected a potential SQL injection risk Pointed out improper expiration time settings for authentication tokens Recommended three performance optimization points Most importantly, it had almost no false alarms. As a developer with a decade of experience, I felt Codex’s review was like feedback from a seasoned senior engineer—not mechanical checks from a tool.\nIf your code is destined for production, always have Codex review it.\nLong-Term Tasks: Claude’s Impressive Stamina In the final days of testing, I assigned both AIs a highly complex task: building a complete blog system from scratch, including front-end, back-end, database design, and API documentation.\nSuch large-scale tasks require hours of continuous work. Here, Claude demonstrated impressive stamina. Official data claims it can work continuously for 30+ hours without losing focus. While I didn’t test this extreme scenario, I did find it remained stable and focused during hours of consecutive work, with no “distractions.”\nGPT-5-Codex has an official rating of 7 hours for continuous work. In my tests, it struggled slightly more than Claude with long tasks—but its output quality remained high.\nIf you have ultra-large refactoring projects or need AI to work independently for extended periods, Claude is the better choice.\nMy Best Practice: Combining Both Tools Is the Key After two weeks of in-depth testing, I refined a workflow that boosted my efficiency by at least 50%:\nStep 1: Rapid Prototyping (Use Claude) When I have a new idea or need to quickly validate a concept, I start with Claude Sonnet 4.5. Its speed lets me see results in the shortest time possible for fast iterations—especially for UI tasks, where Claude is my go-to assistant.\nStep 2: Code Review (Use Codex) Once the feature is basically complete, I pass the code to GPT-5-Codex for review. This step is critical, as Codex often uncovers issues missed by Claude (and even by me), providing professional advice on security, performance, and edge cases.\nStep 3: Optimization \u0026 Refactoring (Use Codex) If the code needs optimization or refactoring, I prefer Codex. It maintains stricter control over code quality and considers more factors comprehensively.\nStep 4: Documentation \u0026 Testing (Use Both) Test cases: Claude generates more comprehensive ones Technical documentation: Claude writes more detailed content Code comments: Codex is more precise A Quick Guide to Choosing the Right Tool Based on two weeks of practice, I compiled a quick reference table for tool selection:\nScenario Recommended Tool Front-end UI development Claude Sonnet 4.5 Rapid prototype validation Claude Sonnet 4.5 Data analysis scripts Claude Sonnet 4.5 Long-running complex tasks Claude Sonnet 4.5 Detailed documentation/ explanations Claude Sonnet 4.5 Back-end API development GPT-5-Codex Production bug fixes GPT-5-Codex Code review GPT-5-Codex Large codebase refactoring GPT-5-Codex Cost-sensitive bulk tasks GPT-5-Codex Critical feature development Both (Claude for building → Codex for review) Large projects Both (divide tasks for collaboration) Learning new technologies Both (compare explanations) Real-World Pitfalls to Avoid Here are the pitfalls I encountered—hopefully, they help you avoid similar mistakes:\nBlindly trusting benchmark scores: While Claude scored higher on SWE-bench (77.2% vs. 74.5%), this doesn’t mean it will perform better in your specific project. I found Codex’s code to be more reliable for complex business logic. Focusing only on price, not efficiency: Codex is indeed cheaper, but if your time is valuable, Claude’s speed may save you more in the long run (and vice versa). Skipping code review: Never blindly trust AI output—regardless of which tool you use. I’ve made it a habit to have critical code cross-reviewed by both AIs. Final Thoughts Two weeks of in-depth testing gave me a comprehensive understanding of these two tools. Each has its strengths, and neither can fully replace the other.\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is like an agile, creative young developer—fast, and ideal for rapid iteration and exploration.\nGPT-5-Codex is more like an experienced, meticulous senior engineer—slower, but its solutions are always well-thought-out and comprehensive.\nThe best strategy isn’t to choose one over the other, but to learn to use the right tool for the right scenario.\nIf you’re also using these two tools, feel free to share your experiences in the comments. If you haven’t tried them yet, I hope this article helps you avoid unnecessary detours.\nIt’s 2025, and AI-assisted programming is no longer the future—it’s the present. Programmers who don’t use AI may well be replaced by those who do.\nBut more importantly, learning to choose and combine these tools is a new essential skill.\n","wordCount":"1561","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:11530/images/uploads/claude-codex.png","datePublished":"2025-10-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-10-24T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Aries"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:11530/posts/claude-vs-gpt-5-codex-two-weeks-of-in-depth-usage/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Best AI Tools for 2025","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:11530/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:11530/ accesskey=h title="Best AI Tools for 2025 (Alt + H)">Best AI Tools for 2025</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

For example, it criticized a function name for being “non-standard,” even though it aligned with our team’s internal conventions.</li><li>GPT-5-Codex’s review was slower but far more accurate. Every issue it identified hit the mark:<ul><li>Detected a potential SQL injection risk</li><li>Pointed out improper expiration time settings for authentication tokens</li><li>Recommended three performance optimization points</li></ul></li></ul><p>Most importantly, it had almost no false alarms. As a developer with a decade of experience, I felt Codex’s review was like feedback from a seasoned senior engineer—not mechanical checks from a tool.</p><p>If your code is destined for production, always have Codex review it.</p><h2 id=long-term-tasks-claudes-impressive-stamina>Long-Term Tasks: Claude’s Impressive Stamina<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#long-term-tasks-claudes-impressive-stamina>#</a></h2><p>In the final days of testing, I assigned both AIs a highly complex task: building a complete blog system from scratch, including front-end, back-end, database design, and API documentation.</p><p>Such large-scale tasks require hours of continuous work. Here, Claude demonstrated impressive stamina. Official data claims it can work continuously for 30+ hours without losing focus. While I didn’t test this extreme scenario, I did find it remained stable and focused during hours of consecutive work, with no “distractions.”</p><p>GPT-5-Codex has an official rating of 7 hours for continuous work. In my tests, it struggled slightly more than Claude with long tasks—but its output quality remained high.</p><p>If you have ultra-large refactoring projects or need AI to work independently for extended periods, Claude is the better choice.</p><h2 id=my-best-practice-combining-both-tools-is-the-key>My Best Practice: Combining Both Tools Is the Key<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#my-best-practice-combining-both-tools-is-the-key>#</a></h2><p>After two weeks of in-depth testing, I refined a workflow that boosted my efficiency by at least 50%:</p><h3 id=step-1-rapid-prototyping-use-claude>Step 1: Rapid Prototyping (Use Claude)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-1-rapid-prototyping-use-claude>#</a></h3><p>When I have a new idea or need to quickly validate a concept, I start with Claude Sonnet 4.5. Its speed lets me see results in the shortest time possible for fast iterations—especially for UI tasks, where Claude is my go-to assistant.</p><h3 id=step-2-code-review-use-codex>Step 2: Code Review (Use Codex)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-2-code-review-use-codex>#</a></h3><p>Once the feature is basically complete, I pass the code to GPT-5-Codex for review. This step is critical, as Codex often uncovers issues missed by Claude (and even by me), providing professional advice on security, performance, and edge cases.</p><h3 id=step-3-optimization--refactoring-use-codex>Step 3: Optimization & Refactoring (Use Codex)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-3-optimization--refactoring-use-codex>#</a></h3><p>If the code needs optimization or refactoring, I prefer Codex. It maintains stricter control over code quality and considers more factors comprehensively.</p><h3 id=step-4-documentation--testing-use-both>Step 4: Documentation & Testing (Use Both)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-4-documentation--testing-use-both>#</a></h3><ul><li>Test cases: Claude generates more comprehensive ones</li><li>Technical documentation: Claude writes more detailed content</li><li>Code comments: Codex is more precise</li></ul><h2 id=a-quick-guide-to-choosing-the-right-tool>A Quick Guide to Choosing the Right Tool<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-quick-guide-to-choosing-the-right-tool>#</a></h2><p>Based on two weeks of practice, I compiled a quick reference table for tool selection:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Recommended Tool</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Front-end UI development</td><td>Claude Sonnet 4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Rapid prototype validation</td><td>Claude Sonnet 4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Data analysis scripts</td><td>Claude Sonnet 4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Long-running complex tasks</td><td>Claude Sonnet 4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Detailed documentation/ explanations</td><td>Claude Sonnet 4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Back-end API development</td><td>GPT-5-Codex</td></tr><tr><td>Production bug fixes</td><td>GPT-5-Codex</td></tr><tr><td>Code review</td><td>GPT-5-Codex</td></tr><tr><td>Large codebase refactoring</td><td>GPT-5-Codex</td></tr><tr><td>Cost-sensitive bulk tasks</td><td>GPT-5-Codex</td></tr><tr><td>Critical feature development</td><td>Both (Claude for building → Codex for review)</td></tr><tr><td>Large projects</td><td>Both (divide tasks for collaboration)</td></tr><tr><td>Learning new technologies</td><td>Both (compare explanations)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=real-world-pitfalls-to-avoid>Real-World Pitfalls to Avoid<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#real-world-pitfalls-to-avoid>#</a></h2><p>Here are the pitfalls I encountered—hopefully, they help you avoid similar mistakes:</p><ol><li><strong>Blindly trusting benchmark scores</strong>: While Claude scored higher on SWE-bench (77.2% vs. 74.5%), this doesn’t mean it will perform better in your specific project. I found Codex’s code to be more reliable for complex business logic.</li><li><strong>Focusing only on price, not efficiency</strong>: Codex is indeed cheaper, but if your time is valuable, Claude’s speed may save you more in the long run (and vice versa).</li><li><strong>Skipping code review</strong>: Never blindly trust AI output—regardless of which tool you use. I’ve made it a habit to have critical code cross-reviewed by both AIs.</li></ol><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#final-thoughts>#</a></h2><p>Two weeks of in-depth testing gave me a comprehensive understanding of these two tools. Each has its strengths, and neither can fully replace the other.</p><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 is like an agile, creative young developer—fast, and ideal for rapid iteration and exploration.</p><p>GPT-5-Codex is more like an experienced, meticulous senior engineer—slower, but its solutions are always well-thought-out and comprehensive.</p><p>The best strategy isn’t to choose one over the other, but to learn to use the right tool for the right scenario.</p><p>If you’re also using these two tools, feel free to share your experiences in the comments. If you haven’t tried them yet, I hope this article helps you avoid unnecessary detours.</p><p>It’s 2025, and AI-assisted programming is no longer the future—it’s the present. Programmers who don’t use AI may well be replaced by those who do.</p><p>But more importantly, learning to choose and combine these tools is a new essential skill.</p></div><footer
