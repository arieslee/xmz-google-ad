Now, you just need to throw it at Gemini and say “Make it into a PPT,” bingo! A complete, designed PPT is ready.\nTime required? Less than a minute.\nFurthermore, this isn’t some shoddy text dump—each slide comes with images, design, and clear hierarchy.\nThe best part? Free users can use it too.\nLet’s give a shout-out to the generous folks at Google.\n01 | The Underestimated Canvas Those who frequently use Gemini are likely familiar with the Canvas feature.\nWhile it was launched following the trend set by Claude and ChatGPT, the experience is actually quite good.\nCanvas was originally a separate workspace, primarily used for writing and coding tasks.\nThe new feature we’re discussing today is hidden within Canvas.\nYou can either give Gemini a topic to generate a PPT from scratch, or upload documents, images, and tables as source material.\nJust like this.\nGemini will generate a complete PPT directly based on your materials.\nWhat’s even better is that Google has integrated its own ecosystem—the generated PPT can be directly imported into Google Slides for further editing.\nIt handles everything from content generation to collaborative editing, all in one seamless flow.\n02 | How to Use It? 3 Simple Steps Currently, this feature is only available on the Gemini web version and is not yet supported in the mobile app.\nThe good news is, both free users and AI Pro members can use it (personally verified).\nOpen Gemini and log in.\nKey Point: You must select Canvas from the toolbar in the bottom-left corner of the input box.\nTests show that failing to do this only generates an outline, not the full PPT.\nThen, simply input your prompt in a conversational style, instructing Gemini to generate the PPT.\nFor example: “Create a PPT based on this document.”\nRemember to upload any necessary source files.\n03 | Hands-On Test: Trying it with NVIDIA’s Earnings Report I used NVIDIA’s latest earnings report to test this feature.\nLet’s look at the results directly.\nAs you can see, what Gemini generates isn’t just a wall of text, but a complete PPT with pre-defined themes and images.\nHere’s the crucial part: All the images in the PPT above were found and added by Gemini itself.\nThe original NVIDIA earnings report contained only text and tables, no images.\nHonestly, it might look more professional than what I could make myself.\nThe generated PPT can be imported into Google Slides to open and edit, or it can be exported directly as a PDF.\nOf course, it’s difficult to generate a perfect PPT on the first try.\nAt this point, you have two options:\nImport it into Google Slides and edit manually. Continue the conversation within Gemini, asking it to make revisions. Tests show the revision feature works quite well.\nHowever, each revision requires regenerating the entire PPT, which can be time-consuming.\nConclusion ChatGPT doesn’t have a feature to directly generate PPTs.\nClaude has one, but the results are relatively mediocre.\nI’ve tested quite a few AI-powered PPT generation tools before, and currently, Gemini offers the best overall performance.\nBut it’s not a magic bullet.\nIts greatest value lies in solving the “from 0 to 1” problem, helping you quickly build a framework and generate a first draft.\nAs for “polishing from an 80 to a 95,” you still need to rely on yourself to adjust the content and optimize the design.\nIt’s a good tool, but its effectiveness depends on how you use it.\nOne thing is certain: The barrier to creating PPTs has been completely leveled.\n","wordCount":"608","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:8819/images/uploads/google-geimini-cover.png","datePublished":"2025-11-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-11-05T15:45:34+08:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Aries"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:8819/posts/2025-11-05/gemini-ppt-generator/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Best AI Tools for 2025 | Weekly Hands-On Reviews","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:8819/images/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5478679201552725" crossorigin=anonymous></script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:8819/ accesskey=h title="Best AI Tools for 2025 (Alt + H)">Best AI Tools for 2025</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
